# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I'm Mouli Suri, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, passionate about blending hardware with software to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on embedded systems, robotics, and exploring the intersection of AI and technology.<br><br>Throughout my academic journey, I've taken on hands-on projects like building color-sorting robots using Arduino, creating calculators using PIC microcontrollers, and contributing to open-source projects like Blender. These experiences have strengthened my skills in embedded systems, programming, and technical documentation.<br><br>I'm always curious to learn new technologies and take on challenges that help me grow both as an engineer and a problem-solver. I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills in AI, embedded systems, or software engineering to build impactful solutions.
